# How-Hard-feelings-have

people's may be judged by their perspective, they will mock, they will try to take all your peace.

but, end of the day you will be alone as usual, as a human you have to communicate with them.
based on their actions that doesn't mean to take revenge when we succeed in life.
success is not to explain others what you feel, success is satisfaction with what you have.
if we wasted time like regular day's, one day our soul will mock us, not people's, relatives, not even friends, only our self will mock if we are lazy.
and that day you will realise the true colour of you.
yes, this world is judgemental, corruption, but end of the day they are humans with humanity.
taking revenge on other's is evil, taking revenge on your thoughts, your actions will lead you success.
don't wait for other's judgement or don't too much care about their words, just cross check their words with your self.
if fine do it with your own,
if not change yourself.
